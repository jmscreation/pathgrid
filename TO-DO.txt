PathGrid Memory Updates:

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Units cannot pass a row of units! Must solve!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! %

Units keep moving when at destination 1/2 %

Units should move toward destination even if it's not reachable (limit pathfinder spread) %

Units should not move to a cell that directs the unit back to its starting cell

Implement a way to invert the PathFinder %

Allow path finder algorithm to be used for both diagonal and non-diagonal cell approaches
